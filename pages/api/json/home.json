        "For over 25 years, I have been the performing as a clown and children's entertainer across Manchester, Lancashire, Merseyside and the rest of The North West. It's always a pleasure to see smiles and joy on the faces of the families I meet and spreading magic and joy is what life is all about.",
        "For me, the best part of being a clown and performing as Louby Lou, is being able to see happy parents, giggling children and above all, sharing and creating memories that will last a lifetime! This is something I have been doing since the age of 6, developing my skills, travelling and performing in the entertainment business, following in my father's footsteps, Trumble The Clown.",
        "Every show is different, whether its a private party, birthday celebration, corporate event or festival performance, but each gig has a base of good old-fashioned, traditional clowning and childrens entertainment. Over the years my style and shows have evolved, with the inclusion of puppetry, some Ibiza dance tunes, with a dash of saxophone and of course, plenty of magic! The perfect recipe for an amazing party atmosphere!",
        "So if you'd like to hear more about me or experience some giggles for yourself, then please, get in touch, I can't wait to hear from you!"
