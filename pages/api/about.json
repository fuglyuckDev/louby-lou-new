            "aboutMeDetails": "Heya! Lucy here, AKA Louby Lou! the North West’s #1 female clown! For 25 years I’ve been spreading giggles, Joy and Fun all around the North West! The best part of being a clown is being able to witness smiling parents, giggling children and above all sharing and creating memories that will last a lifetime! Since the ripe old age of 6, I’ve been developing my skills within the entertainment business, following in my father's footsteps, perfecting the recipe for the perfect celebration! It starts with a base of good old-fashioned clown skills, laced with a generous dose of modern Ibiza dance tunes and a dash of the unexpected! A true recipe for Excitement! And who knows, maybe one of my 3 wonderful girls will carry the Louby Lou Legacy!",
