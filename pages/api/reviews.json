Every child had huge smiles on their faces and were mesmerised throughout. Worth every penny. The comments I received after my daughter’s christening about Louby Lou were all so positive and guest commented on how the show was different from the typical children’s entertainer show. We can’t wait to book her again.",

We booked Louby Lou for a 2 hour show for my daughters 5th birthday, all the children loved her from start to finish and the parents thought she was great too! Everyone has since commented on how brilliant Louby Lou was and how much their child loved it - everyone had a ball! I would 100% recommend Louby Lou as she did everything so brilliantly which made things so easy for us to enjoy our daughter’s day!",
